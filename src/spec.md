## Summary
**Goal:** Build Dragon Games Store, a gaming marketplace website where customers can browse games and order via WhatsApp, with an admin panel to manage the catalog.

**Planned changes:**
- Create homepage with DGS logo, store description, platform badges (PC/PS5/PS4/Xbox), and trust indicators
- Implement horizontal scrolling game catalog with arrow navigation, displaying game cards with images, "SALE!" badges, prices, and "Buy Now" buttons
- Add game detail view showing trailer video, description, and "Buy Now" button
- Integrate WhatsApp redirect (https://wa.me/918757242955) with pre-filled order message
- Build admin panel with Internet Identity authentication for adding games (image upload, name, trailer URL, description, price)
- Create backend data model and functions to store and retrieve games
- Apply white background with black text theme throughout, with blue/white accents for badges and buttons

**User-visible outcome:** Customers can browse a horizontal game catalog, view game details with trailers, and order games via WhatsApp. Admin can add new games through an authenticated admin panel accessible from multiple devices.
